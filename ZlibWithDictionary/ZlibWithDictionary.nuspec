      This is a plain wrapper around DotNetZip that allows Deflate compression with preset dictionary.
      This is particularly useful for compressing small byte-sequences (diminishing returns beyond 32k) where the content being compressed follows predictable patterns such a web-service results following a known schema or html documents.
      The best dictionary is one that is contains substrings that are likely to occur in the input - the longer the matching substrings, and the more likely they occur in the input, the better.
      The only two methods provided are DeflateCompression.ZlibCompressWithDictionary and Deflate.ZlibDecompressWithDictionary (intellisense explains the parameters).
      Per the DotNetZip docs, this compression is compatible with the deflate RFC1950 as implemented by the common zlib library (ref: http://zlib.net).
      (Note that although gzip uses the same algorithm, it uses a slightly different and thus incompatible header.)
